Review,Polarity
"I've read several critical reviews applauding this film, however having sat through it twice I have to point out that this is a very poor film.",Neg
"Shang-Chi gave me hope for Phase 4 of Marvel. Eternals dashed those hopes. This is probably my least favorite Marvel movie. This film is too long and crammed full of overly complicated plot points, yet it's also completely predictable. It seems the filmmakers were too busy trying to check off boxes rather than create a good story. It's also a downer. People watch MCU movies to have fun, not to have existential crises. Perhaps the Eternals should have stood on the sidelines a little longer.",Neg
"Another year, another Marvel Studios superhero movie, right? Well, so it would seem. I had only vaguely heard about ""Eternals"" prior to sitting down to watch it. But then again, superhero movies isn't exactly my primary go-to-movie choice. But yeah, I do watch them if given the chance, as Marvel Studios does churn out movies that are fun enough if for nothing else then for the amazing CGI.",Pos
"The Eternals are immortals created to eliminate the destructive Deviants. 7000 years ago, ten Eternals were sent to Earth. They were able to eliminate the last Deviant 500 years ago and have been waiting to go home ever since.",Neu
"I'm not going to give a long winded review though the movie was long. ""Eternal"" was the runtime. There were parts that were good and parts that weren't. One of the biggest issues is that a movie of this nature presents more questions than it answers. The very existence of eternal beings existing on planet Earth, sent there by their creator in order to protect human life from Deviants, begs a lot of questions. And the more they strayed from their prime directive, the more questions they presented. The eternals were human in every aspect with the exception of their powers and their lifespan. The fact that such humanlike and very fallible beings (as in not entirely obedient) were sent to protect humans is just a start of the questions.",Neg
"Ok but how are they speaking english since they are before the time when english language was spoken? I was extremely disappointed with this movie. The amount of plot holes and wasted potential was really annoying and Sersei had 0 personality. The visuals were amazing but it doesn't make up for the lack of logic put into the movie. The powers were so inconsistent and the prime eternal was just wasted after not even putting up a fight. The deviants were wasted as well and the celestials not telling the eternals why they're on the planet made no sense. Just so many reasons to dislike the execution of the movie. This was a lame movie, there is always a useless hero in every show and Thena was this movies useless hero... How tf you let your man die right in front of you. Thanos IS a Deviant-Eternal. So where's the logic. This movie was completely overrated i'm sorry. This film was the worst mcu film. So boring and the plot was all over the place.",Neg
"The 26th instalment in the Marvel Cinematic Universe marks the arrival of a new brand of superheroes into their ever-growing family and further expands the horizons of its shared universe with its grand scope. However, being one of the lesser-known properties the way Guardians was back in 2014, Eternals needed to create an intrigue & curiosity to make us care & invest in its mythic world but the film as a whole simply falls flat at it.",Neg
"I went in knowing nothing about the source material and not watching a single trailer. I had no expectations for this movie. After watching it, I feel like it had the potential to be incredible. But it wasn't. It wasn't even good. I'm legitimately sad while writing this.",Neg
"Trying to be ""deep"", the director uses some long shots (or longer than usual in the MCU) here and there, less frenetic editing here and there, and less Marvel humor (there is enough though), in a thing that turned to be a really, really bad experiment. Valient effort though?",Neg
"A couple of years ago, there was The Inhumans mini-series, featuring superheroes who lived on the Moon, but were supposedly protecting Earth. Now the Eternals are doing the same thing, with a similar cast of superheroes.",Neu
"And then magic happened, Eternals on Disney streaming. Another entry in the Marvel world. And have seen enough trailers I was ready for it, it looked great but...",Neg
"Chlo√© Zhao's direction gives Marvel Cinematic Universe a much needed breath of fresh air, but 'Eternals' doesn't quite come together. Despite the fact the film claims to have a far more thought-provoking theme and a plethora of philosophical concepts, it fails to elaborate on them sufficiently to create a more compelling experience. The movie is still magnificent to look but it's pretty much lifeless with boring actors playing boring characters.",Neg
"Eternals had the potential to be a real standout film from the crowd, but it missed out on breaking ranks from its franchise's long-held cliches like 'action scene then funny one-liner' moments that don't feel like character moments anymore, but 'creative mandates' imposed by the studio.",Neg
"I can understand Marvel wanting to expand its universe; all you have to do is look at the dollars to understand it. But, the thing about superheroes, they have to be super beyond their powers. I didn't know anything about these characters and frankly after watching this movie I don't want to know anymore. I thought Justice league and Batman versus Superman were bad. But nothing has been as boring as this movie. It's cheesy and preachy with no interesting characters except Sprite and the Deviant. I think they may need to stop cause superhero overload can cause bad movie making decisions.",Neg
"Following the events of Avengers: Endgame (2019), an unexpected tragedy forces the Eternals, ancient aliens who have been living on Earth in secret for thousands of years, out of the shadows to reunite against mankind's most ancient enemy, the Deviants.",Neu
"Not the greatest ""Marvel"" movie fan yet I gave ""Eternals"" a try even though never really hearing about it or reading the comics, and was not real impressed as the movie went back and fourth thru the ages and time as the group of Eternals were always fighting evil and the movie was a showcase of love and family like feel. It was an eye candy watch for seeing the hot and sexy Gemma Chan and Salma Hayek as immortals Sersi and Ajak as both were healers and watchers of the group. Overall my interest came and went the film for one was to long and drawn out as the message could have been shorter. Still I guess a watch if your a Marvel movie fan, and the look of Gemma Chan and Salma Hayek as superheroes was sexy and impressive.",Neu
"This was almost a dead-even 5/10 star film, but the more I think about it, the less I like it. I HAAAATED some of the incredibly cheap looking CGI. Sure, SOME of it was good, but our main villains, the devil-alien dogs were laughably fake looking and the 1st post-credit scene had this small ""creature"" who was about on par with Super Nintendo graphics. Also, only some of the humor landed, but most felt forced. I did LOVE all the diversity and acting - each actor really tried their best. The plot is okay, but it did drag and shoot, am I tired of hearing excuses when MCU introduces new Super-Human characters who were around for wars, including the Infinity War, and did nothing to help/prevent it. Either you need to reboot everything or make origin stories set in present day only. Finally, I 100% hated the inclusion of a particular reference in regards to comparing the lead male Eternal, Ikaris to another superhero.",Neg
"The whole plot was terrible . They focused all the attention for almost 2 hours on the deviance and all of a sudden it turns out they're not the bad guys after all let's focus 30 minutes of the rest of the movie on someone else.. Marvel failed a great cast with a terrible script. Marvel should separate Eternals film into 2 Parts to have more progressive storyline and deep dive on characterization and the build up of motivation to save the Earth with balanced action sequences and dramas in between... Eternals Book 1 and Eternals Book 2. Just like what Warner did on Dune film.. or Avengers 3 and 4. Worst movie I've seen in years!!!! Worst MCU movie. Hardly any character development, no reason to care about the characters. Outside if him, the comedy was lackluster. Pace was off. Most performances by the actors were good but their stories were not deep enough, hard to do with that many protagonists in one movie. My first thought was why do the people already have british and scottish accent even before they arrive on earth? Like it would make sense if they all spoke similar english when they first arrive on Earth but when they later end up separating and going their own ways they end up developing their british and scottish accent or whatever. Maybe I'm nitpicking it too much but it was literally the first scene in the movie that just broke my immersion immediately.",Neg
"This review has been declined 3 times now. I don't know why, I think it's cos of the real name of Gilgamesh coinciding with an english word.",Neu
"I am not really impressed this Eternals movie .. looks like amature superpower. Boring fight scenes & not really advantures . Well, overall it still can be watch to the end of this movie . 4/10. This film is actually not fiction at all. Worst film ever it's unbelievably terrible. Im shocked how marvel made this crap, bad acting and even worse story line . Powers are as if a school kid thought them up. Pissed !!! Do not waste your money buying it. That was the most boring Marvel movie ive ever watched! The entire movie is huge plot hole. So Celestials need to seed intelligent life to birth their kind but stood by somehow as Thanos wiped out half of life, then came back to completely wipe out the other half and all of existence? I really want to like this movie but it just didn't really work for me. Really feel like this needed to be a miniseries or spread out across multiple movies. Just too much stuff crammed into a 2 hour period. Didn't give me enough time to care about the characters/story that much, and the wonky pacing and acting didn't help with that either. I don't hate the movie, but could've been so much better.",Neg
"Not really sure why this movie got so much hate. It's introducing a swath of new superhero's and doesn't really converge with any other Avengers plot lines save for a few mentions of Thanos, Thor and some other hero's. That job on its own isn't an easy one and I think they did a fantastic job of giving us a new storyline. The shear scale of the movie was well done both in terms of time periods and in general how epic and massive everything felt. Loved the diversity of the characters - every one of them added something to the story. With that being said - and this is coming from just your average Marvel fan with no knowledge of the comics - the Eternals powers all seemed a bit underwhelming. Maybe it's just that they were trying to display how powerful the deviants were but even Ikaris couldn't take down one on his own. Other than that the movie was absolutely beautifully shot - maybe the best looking Marvel movie to date. Again, I'm not sure what the hate is about but I thoroughly enjoyed watching it.",Pos
"This movie felt like 3 movies supercut into one. Pacing was all over the place. Seems a stretch for me to call most of these characters ""super-heroes,"" most seemed remarkably pathetic in their abilities, some of these ""Eternals"" were so easily killed, yet some inexplicably were tanks. Humor was very weak; the best lines were from the trailer and most of those were cringey. Kit Harrington was wasted. Angelina Jolie was wasted. All the major plot points were just exposition vomit or were so obviously telegraphed. I was never so conflicted in a post-credit scene. On one hand I was grateful for this dreadful movie to be over, and then sacked with absolute apathy that the Eternals ""will return...."" I hope not. I was just so so disappointed, wanted to cry this movie frustrates me sm, lore was thrown out the window, it didnt even seem like the eternals (besides the fast girl) could even fight. I was looking forward for this movie to demonstrate how this era of marvel movies is supposed to be on such a vast scale, no longer being about earth alone but the multiverses.",Neg
"The visuals of ""Eternals"" are spectacular. They look very real and very stylish. I also applaud the film for the diversity of the cast. However, the build up of the film is just too slow and too long, and I lost most of my interest and concentration when the final showdown begins. In addition, the one liner jokes are a little out of place and quite contrived. It is still an entertaining film, but probably not as great as the recent Marvel films.",Neu
"The Eternals tries breaking MCU ranks whilst suffering from sequel-teasing and not enough narrative breathing room to let the screenplay really shine through the film's many inconsistencies (be it Icarus' arc and the logic of the alien-super-race as the antagonists). This film claims to be more diverse than the rest of the canon, but it's more of the same action-then-punchline stuff some weary viewers just can't shake off any longer. The formula's starting to show its cracks and can't be used to introduce characters for uninitiated viewers like they did with The Avengers or Spider-Man (characters we now have collective knowledge on).",Neg
A -{ B I G }- Screen Review ; Film Seen TWICE By Me.,Neu
"Maybe finally Marvel has lost its way, after three very bad TV shows we now get this. A dull, lifeless, energy pulling mess of a film. As other have said no chemistry, no decent characters a waste of good actors who have a rubbish and talky script to content with, a grey dull look to the film. It was like wathcing a blank screen, you are seeing something in front of you but it is not saying or doing anything, it certainly not moving you in any way, and the repeated failed attempts at humour. The only thing it does, again in a bad way is tick of all the woke and pc boxes. I thought Wonder Woman 1984 was bad this made that look passable.",Neg
As a huge fan of Sci fi and past Marvel movies and series I can say with a sad heart that since the takeover by Disney and the sad passing of the late legend Stan Lee every production under the Marvel name has been Dreadful and this latest offering is no exception!,Neg
"The fact that 'Eternals (2021)' doesn't feel like a Marvel movie isn't an inherently good or bad thing. To me, it feels more distinct than most of the studio's other fare, but it isn't as entertaining. As a whole, the thing just feels a bit flat. It's messy, overly portentous and filled with some pretty baffling choices. Chief among these is the decision to have one of its characters straight-up disappear from the finale for no real reason, only to rear his head again just before the piece comes to a close. The ending (which includes two post-credits stings) is incredibly disappointing, evoking the exact opposite of its intended effect. There are plenty of other plot problems, too. They pale in comparison to the fact that most of the movie just feels fairly lifeless, though. It's pretty dull, to be honest. That being said, it does have its merits. Firstly, the cast are all really good despite the fact that they don't have much to work with. Ma Dong-Seok (here credited as Don Lee) is the obvious highlight, though he's criminally underused. Secondly, there are a handful of scenes which start to properly explore the interesting concepts inherent to the heroes' long-lasting lifespans. Unsurprisingly, the best of these involve actual conflict between the core characters and portray each player's different outlook on their unique situation. Sadly, most characters lack chemistry with one another and often seem isolated from the other people that share the frame with them. They aren't allowed to properly come to life, which is one of the biggest reasons that the piece just isn't all that compelling; we have nobody to care about. This also means that the movie feels as though it lacks real stakes, even though it's literally the entire Earth that's in danger. Without a character to latch onto, we simply don't give a second thought to the humans our heroes are trying to save. However, the feature is visually pleasing overall. The cinematography is suitably 'epic' and the various locations are presented with bold colours and distinct architecture. There are also a couple of entertaining, if slightly intangible, action sequences. The best of these, which is also the best portion of the entire affair, is a mid-point battle set in a remote village. For the most part, though, even the set-pieces fall short of the mark. Overall, this is a pretty disappointing film. It has a strange structure, a sloppy story and generally just feels a bit off. It's far too long, yet somehow not long enough; it would've been much better served as a mini-series. It has its moments, but it just isn't all that good. 5/10.",Neg
"Is this the best MCU movie yet? Not by a long shot. But they manage to establish the Eternals, Celestial, Eros, Black Knight, and Blade and still make it work.",Pos
"Well, I gave it a shot. Everything bad thing you have heard about this movie is TRUE. You care ZERO about the characters. Its like the writers and director were focusing on.......other things they thought were more important instead of good story telling, a good script, etc...",Neg
Personally 6.5/10,Pos
I personally feel like this movie is very underrated. It's not as jokey or flashy as any of the other Marvel movies but that's kind of why I like it. It felt less like a superhero movie and more like an art film about gods and what it does to your psyche when you live for such a long time on the planet that's not yours.,Pos
"Some will love it some will hate it, whichever category you're in you're lying out your back teeth saying this is either the worst or best MCU movie, at best this movie is a 5, at its worst its a 2,I've opted for the latter simply because this movie fails at pretty much everything it attempts:
story; lacklustre.",Neg
An excellent film that Marvel fans will love! Really enjoy all the characters and fight sequences. The story is really well written and moves at a good pace for being a longer film.,Pos
"Okay, bear with me since this will be a difficult review. I don't particularly think this was ruined by too many characters as Endgame had 31+ characters, but suffered from poor pacing, runtime, and the lack of character development. I have to say that I did not enjoy this film as I am not into mythology stuff. The first and second acts were painfully boring with a bit decent third act. Ajak was given nothing to her character. Sersi. I almost have no idea what to say about her, but her personality should have been interesting. For Ikaris, I was not interested in the romance between him and Sersi. The sex scene wasn't needed at all, although I am surprised that have gotten away from that in a PG-13 movie. He does have a few fun scenes where he speculates a table to be made out of vibranium, slams it which turned out it isn't. ""I don't wear a cape."" Kingo was a decent and fun character that I mostly enjoyed throughout the movie. He had an interesting character setting where he has a fondness for movies and modern technology as he is a famous Bollywood movie star, dancer, and director who has fun with humans. Karun was also a fun presence with great chemistry with Kingo. The stuff about him and filming a documentary was hilarious. For Sprite. Oh my god. I think she has to be my least favorite character in this movie, there isn't anything interesting about her, and she always whines. Phastos was not bad, but a decent character. I have to say that the 1945 scene was mentally heartbreaking commenting on how advancing technology can have brutal consequences. Druig. I do have big mixed feelings about him. He does somewhat have a character arc where he doesn't want the humans to have a conflict so he uses his powers to stop them, but is stopped by the group. Eventually, in the third act, he learns to not interfere with conflicts, but still, I don't like him either way. Makkari wasn't annoying like the others as she has a likable personality, lack of ability to speak. She's fun and has a great dynamic with the team. Also, I liked how they treated her speed ability. Thena does actually have somewhat of an interesting character arc where she can have episodes that make her go rogue against the team which leads her to go with Gilgamesh in order to make anything to not go worse. The scenes of her fighting with her weapons are quite entertaining. Overall, this is just meh.",Neg
"For the first 40 minutes I had no clue what, why, who, where and again what? The characters are written really badly and the story was a drag at times. The VFX was as good as any Marvels film but everything else was so bad that it doesn't deserve a watch especially the casting. Every single lead was bad. I can't digest Salma Hayek. She's the same person, talking like the same character for more than 2 decades with different clothes. Pathetic. Kunal nanjijkdjdhg should stop acting. I don't know if he is being realistic or sarcastic when he opens his mouth. I don't know if that little girl is actually little or a girl. There is no back story for the characters. I haven't read the comics, so I have no clue what I saw. Why not the next film have al chinese actors only because that's where marvels is headed to.",Neg
"This was a movie that when I was behind on watching the Marvel Cinematic Universe had me intrigued to jump in to watch. This was a comic line that I wasn't familiar with. It did look like they used mythology so that pulled my interest. This was a movie that I watched in parts while feeding my newborn daughter, Mackenzie, as well.",Pos
"The longest, boring, woke, PC sermon I have ever watched.",Neg
"Eternals (2021) :
Movie Review -",Neu
It has got to win Best Picture at the Oscars!,Pos
"Spite lived on Earth for thousands of years and speaks Spanish like she just took a middle school Spanish course. The jokes are flat. The acting is stilted. I'm surprised this is a Marvel movie. As WTH?!...Celestials are born out of planets that are populated to a certain point, but couldn't just wipe out the Deviants. It's such a strange choice for a movie plot. It is a bad movie. Such a disappointment.",Neg
"This is ranked as the least critically acclaimed MCU movie ever made and boy, can I see why. Having not liked ""Black Widow"" as much as I thought I would, I can easily say it's still better than this. This movie features the Eternals who were created thousands of years ago to protect the Earth from monsters called the Deviants. Halfway through, it's revealed their creators, the Celestials were planting seeds in the Earth as they must destroy planets to create a new Celestial. A planet must have a certain population before the Celestial seed can grow. Why didn't they intervene when Thanos destroyed half the Universe, seeing as how a reduced population would greatly hinder their plans?",Neg
"....just very different to all the other superhero/comic movies out there. This is not about any random villain fighting against the god guys, the backstory is a metaphor for Creation, god(s) and sacrifice in the form of Transformation. That makes it very different and gives it mich more depth than those other random CGI orgies. Highly recommend!",Pos
"After the events of Infinity War and Endgame, it was hard to see how any Marvel film could match those films' epic scope and stakes, yet in many ways, Eternals does so.",Pos
I was really excited for this movie and went to see this with good expectations but nothing went as expected.,Neg
"I went in with little to no expectations and I was pleasantly surprised by what the movie offered. Multiple relatively unknown new characters and their dynamics, their stories spanning centuries.",Pos
"Convoluted, confusing, all over the place and full of strange and weird creative decisions. 2h30 and it's still feels way undercooked.",Neg
"As a MCU fan, after one hour I was just so disappointed and bored. I couldn't believe someone approved this after all the movies who came before. Was expecting Marvel to have already figured out a formula for making an enjoyable movie for all kind of viewers, but wrong I was.",Neg
"The new MCU film introduces us to the Eternals, a group I knew absolutely nothing about going in... as well as a few other characters that pop up.. one of whom I was more familiar with. This is an interesting film, that opens up a bunch of new storylines for future films.. but the film itself... I feel like it was a bit of a misfire.. which is very rare for Marvel... the film contains a lot of world building stuff to set up the Eternals storyline which requires an awful lot of flashbacks and back story... which hampers the forward momentum of the main story... The cast is decent, Gemma Chan does most of the heavy lifting.. but they really waste Angelina Jolie and especially Salma Hayek in the film. It gets better in the last act but sadly this might be the weakest Marvel film since the MCU started.",Neg
"Who is the target audience, this is like 4hours long and just not interesting. It has too much c.g.i. This has so much going on you just feel like turning off as plot is a mess.",Neg
"Meaning if you're going to tell me character 'XX' doesn't represent character 'XX' in the comics... yeah, I just don't care. Better, I just don't know.",Neg
"This was the most unremarkable superhero movie I've seen. The writing was lazy, sloppy, clunky, convoluted, incoherent, and riddled with plot issues, especially with the dizzying and boring backstories. Aside from some decent S/VFX, there were zero ""wow"" moments. Rarely do I keep checking my watch to see how much more time I have to put up with this nonsense. Even the casting felt out of place, like anyone off the street can be made to look and act as a superhero. Jolie seemed bored. Gemma Chan and Richard Madden were the only convincing performances. Even each Eternal's superpower was lame, and confusing what exactly they can do (except Madden with his X-Men eye power). The one girl was a deaf Flash? It took four to five writers to come up with this slow-paced 156 min Eternally long and boring nonsense? What a waste of a budget. It's a 6/10 from me. Please, no part 2, and if it is a must, eliminate Chlo√© Zhao and the writers from the equation. Give it to Snyder.",Neg
"Pros:
1. The fight scenes are entertaining, full of action and well choreographed.",Pos
"The problem here is not the gender nor the personality or the orientation of the characters. I'm perfectly fine with that. The problem is watching a movie with so many storylines, background and flashbacks that finally succumbs to its own ambition. Another problem is having plenty of characters, all of them unknown (because if we at least know two or three of them it would be an extraordinary help) and not knowing even what to do with all of them properly. And one more problem is a pacing that doesn't help, and I'm someone who watched a lot of slow burners. Such a shame, because I wanted to like this and prove all their haters were wrong. Not the worst MCU movie to me, but -yeah- one of the worst.",Neg
"If you're looking for an action fest... kinda... and can ignore a story line that just drags on, boy are you gonna love this.",Neg
"Frankly I am not impressed after 45 minutes, and am going to bed...again, no character building at all other than a text intro you are supposed to read to have a clue what the movie is supposed to be about...and then the action and dialog never follows that intro...",Neg
"A vastly different entry into the MCU but one that took me for a ride. It's impressive feat to take on a 10 lead character based film, it's another thing to make you care about every single one of them. Chloe Zhao has already shown us her talent with smaller films, and it's even more telling on a massive MCU scale that she's here to stay. It's hard to say what the best 2021 MCU film is at this point but Eternals has certainly made it's stamp on me. I had a blast.",Pos
"But...... I'm glad I didn't. I saw so many things about this movie being overly ""woke"" and trying to spread itself too thin with all of the characters. I can honestly say I did not go in with high hopes. I felt like those reviews and articles almost stopped me from watching a movie that I really did enjoy. I think the ""boundaries"" pushed were not shoved and ended being tastefully handled. I also didn't feel lost in the amount of characters. We actually went as a group of 12, very different, people, all of which really enjoyed it. I hope nothing stops a sequel from being made because I am very interested in seeing what happens next.",Pos
We can see from the example of the Eternals that different does not always mean better.,Neg
"Probably this is the most beautiful MCU movie. Yeah, there are scenes that just must be seen on the big screen, and the fact that it was shot in real locations says enough about the size of the film. The big cosmic scenes will make you feel small. It's shot with a massive scope, looking visually different and intimate. Chlo√© Zhao has a really unique visual stamp. The cinematography is georgeous!",Pos
"I was excited to see this one. Sadly, that excitement ended fairly quickly! The movie is dark and ridiculous. There are plot holes. Things that should be explained once are repeatedly explained like we're all five years old and Mommy has to keep reminding us. It's just a ridiculous sidestep away from what we've come to expect from a Marvel Movie!",Neg
"Eternals (2021) is a movie my wife and I caught in theatres its opening weekend. The movie tells the tale of Eternal beings sent to Earth to protect it from entities known as deviants. Once they rid the world of deviants they live relatively normal lives among the humans who are now able to flourish. However, when deviants return to the Earth's surface the Eternals will need to get back together to protect humanity and uncover why they've returned.",Neu
"I think this movie got such a trash review because people thought it was too ""woke"" with casting. Which is nonsense by the way. That is how the real world is. It does have its flaws but it's not nearly as bad as people rate it. These 2 & 3 ratings are nonsense. Those people who wrote those might want to try watching movies from a long ways back were they did put out some good movies but also put out tons of trash. This is most certainly not trash. It's pretty good. Decent humor, good action and a good story. Pacing and some of the dialogue is subpar. I will Also say that its run time is a bit much. I actually enjoyed this movie though and I'm very much not disappointed or think that it was a waste of time. It's a very unique take on the internals. I will say that Sercy and Icarus chemistry could've been better. It has its flaws but if you want to sit back and watch a unique interpretation of a comic book Then give it a shot.",Pos
"It's not as bad as a lot of reviewers say, but it's not as good as it could be. It's pacing and mediocre characters are at fault, since you can't really relate to most of the things in the movie. It could have worked better as a TV series like Inhumans (which was not the best one either, but still), in which more time would have been used to draw out the characters and their relationships.",Neg
"There's nothing new here that you'll find, to fascinate, engage or spellbind, it goes on far too long, sub plots aren't that strong, irregular and far from streamlined - but there's some nice CGI and a guy from Avatar makes a guest appearance.",Neg
"Pretty average edition to a great franchise. The film felt directionless and underwhelming. The characters were uninteresting and hard to vouch for, and the best character was a fat Indian side kick. The effects look good, as does the cinematography, but that's a standard for Marvel filmmaking, it's the execution and momentum of the vision that fails.",Neg
Marvel is struggling to make back their budgets in this next chapter of the Cinematic Universe. This was a real chore to get through with the excessive runtime and half-baked ideas; it was both vacant and numbing.,Neg
"Eternals is a kind of movie you need some knowledge of Mesopotamian mythology and Hinduism. I am a Hindu and we believe in many gods and goddesses, and Eternals is about that myth that goes back 7000 to 8000 years and how the divine beings gave us knowledge to make progress. This was an enjoyable movie and the graphics were excellent. It was good to see Hindu gods in the ending credits, like Shiva.",Pos
"From start to finish this film, was a slow mess. Non stop time jumps that seemed unnecessary and confusing to the average viewers. Characters are the most uninteresting to enter the MCU. Acting from some of the actors seemed very bad and stiff. Hopefully the MCU gets it's act together after this film.",Neg
"First, to those who complained about the acting/cast, I guess we weren't watching the same movie, because that's the highlight of this film. Everyone put in a good performance. BUT... as I said, that's the highlight.",Neg
"Like the headline says, this should've been a series to focus on all of the characters instead of a movie trying to force all of the characters and backstories in. It confused the audience.",Neg
"Before the dawn of time a powerful group of immortal aliens descended upon Earth to protect humanity from the Deviants, but after being dormant for centuries they're brought back into action in the present day when a new threat re-emerges. Flashy, scenic, even touristy with some key historical context and filmmaking in-jokes, however the intended emotional moments about humanity's worthiness, evolution, blah-blah-blah...just don't have the desired impact. Clocking in at well over two hours, that still doesn't allow enough time to really forge a connection with many of the characters, thus there isn't much to propel the story forward despite all the various stops along the way; it doesn't bring much of anything new to the table or stand out from the MCU in any particular way. **",Neg
"Uninteresting characters and sub par acting. This was a movie where I felt truely bored. Maybe this movie was in production hell, but man this was pretty bad.",Neg
This is what Hollywood has come to.,Neg
"I was surprised when all the mixed reviews for Eternals started coming in. It had a good cast, an interesting premise, and of course was directed by Chloe Zhao, so I (and presumably many others) had hopes it could be something really good, and a breath of fresh air in the MCU.",Pos
"From the director of ""Nomadland"" which I truly enjoyed, I was expecting way more. Chlo√© Zhao won the Oscar for Best Motion Picture and she is good at telling some kind of stories, but her lack of experience with superhero movies is noticeable. This film is painfully slow and definitely too long, because some storylines take too much screen time. There were basically 7000 years of plot to cover, but the screenplay focuses on some useless story lines, that do not have any kind of impact on the plot. It needs to be heavily cut down. Another thing that I found really annoying is that the movie tells multiple times that ""Eternals"" is part of the MCU, like the audience is composed of a bunch of kids that cannot connect the dots. Disney has been building this narrative universe for more than 10 years. People got the fact that every movie or TV show that Marvel Studios releases is part of it, no need to reiterate. There was a lot of potential, but they did not explore these characters enough and by the end of it, I feel like I barely knew them, so I was not attached to any of them. The acting felt really flat, despite having some class A actors such as Angelina Jolie and Richard Madden. They were not at all convincing. I wonder who decided to hire Gemma Chang, because she portrays one of the most important characters, but she is the most unimpressive element of the cast.",Neg
"For starters, I'm a DC fan and I'll be honest, I was happy when I saw Eternals got the 'rotten rating' in Rotten Tomatoes but I really wanted to watch this cause I'm a fan of Chloe Zhao and I love her movies and her direction.",Pos
Nice movie. Im not sure why Im finding these recent Marvel movies better that most of the last pre-end game ones. Maybe just because Im hearing less favourable things about them and going in with lower expectations. Or it's just a style I like personally,Pos
"What were Marvel thinking, making this. Not one single redeeming feature. This is the only Marvel film I've ever walked out of. It is terrible in every way.",Neg
"Eternals sucked!!!!! It was the worst marvel movie to date!! There was some great actors and actresses in it, but they All were extremely terrible in this trash marvel movie. No one convinced me in their roles. The visual effects were good, but THE STORY LINE SUCKED, THE ACTING SUCKED!!!!!! I thought DC makes bad movies, but Marvel I'm so disappointed, and I was looking forward to watch Eternals.... then I finally watched it and WOW such a huge let down. I'm so glad that I didn't waist my money going to the movies to watch it.. thanks for streaming services!!",Neg
Terrible...watch as Disney destroys yet another classic. Terrible acting and continuity. Relying on pointless battles and CGI. Not recommended........,Neg
"After seeing the critic reviews, I was expecting a mixed bag from the movie when I walked in. Though, I'd still give it a chance as I'm a big fan of the MCU. If it's bad, whatever, I didn't care for the Eternals in the comics anyway.",Pos
Marvel tried way too hard on this overstuffed overlong mess. The acting was good but the actors where underused especially Jolie that's what you get when you have to much characters. The story dragged on and on especially the flash back scenes they could of cut them out completely. The story it self was also just meh and the villain was meh. The movie was just meh.,Neg
"This is going to be a biased review, plain and simple. Firstly I don't care about these (MCU) films anymore whatsoever, thought it would be better after ""Endgame"" to just stop the franchise. Why do they need to keep making films..............oh yeah for money.........my bad I just remembered. If I'm being honest I have been in the minority for a long time, the MCU to me is very hit and miss............although I never thought they could miss this poorly.",Neg
"The film is absolutely awful. The only way you wouldn't exit the theater early is because of spectacular visuals. The decent star cast did their bit well, but the storyline is just as good as watching a candle burn, bland and pointless. I was excited about its Diwali release, but the crackers here didn't burst at all. But yea, the visuals are good but the directing, storyline was below par.",Neg
"Not sure why this film is getting so much bad press, actually thought it was a nice departure from Marvel's usual fair. Visually very impressive, had some interesting themes of theology and some good gags. Less predictable than most of the recent marvel offerings.",Pos
"First of all, I'm going to have to watch this again. There is too much to unpack for just one viewing. There is so much exposition that I got confused often. Especially when bouncing between time periods. The cinematography was fantastic! The action was pretty good. Angelina Jolie was the highlight for me. Can't wait to see fight along side some Avengers. It would have a higher score if it was shorter, had better story flow, & more character balance. I mean, Kit Harrington is barely in it! Ends on a cliffhanger and shows clear direction for where they are going next. I just hope we get to see it!",Pos
"By casting an actress that has already played a major part in one of the films, the Marvel Cinematic Universe has run into a problem it frankly should've run into sooner, given the sheer size of it (just look at how quickly it happened with the poor saps at DC, casting Djimon Hounsou in two separate roles in films released not four months apart). We now have Gemma Chan, who played a Kree in Captain Marvel, in the role of a peaceful Eternal.",Neg
"2.5 hours is way too long for this lackluster of a script. I could go on for so long with items wrong with this movie but if you want to hear it deep and serious which Disney is what trying to do, then let me clearly state it...... it's a very ungodly movie from a spiritual point of view as well as morals and ethics. If you can't see this brainwashing and you find this just simple entertainment then you're the type of sheep that Disney loves. I will just stick with movies that just play simple fantasy fun super hero and not this intentional offense to my Christianity.",Neg
"Boring movie .unnatractive acting. Another Superhero movie lacking depth,complex characterization , or pulling in suspence.",Neg
"While this may not be the best Marvel has to offer it is still a great movie. Solid story line from beginning to end. However I do think that the movie would have done better had it been a stand alone movie & not part of the MCU, it being part of the MCU seems to make it more complicated & convoluted. This problem does seem to cause some plot holes that they try to cover or explain, but that's not truly enough for me. But on a good note, I do find the fighting very interesting to watch they seem to move different when you compare their style to that of Iron Man or Thor. In the end people can find problems in the characters , the plot or the message, just give it a chance & a watch.",Pos
"Eternals are a bunch of ancient super heroes put on earth thousands of years ago to save mankind from vicious monsters - deviants. After ridding the planet of the creatures, they are forced to come back together in the present day when the monsters start reappearing, seemingly with greater powers.",Neu
"The movie goes more into the origins of the eternals and gives you an insight into each of their personalities. Don't go in expecting an all out established set of characters kicking ass from start to finish. The story is fairly well told but I must admit that it does lack some action but the action you do get is very well done and visually stunning, especially those that feature Thena (Angelina Jolie) and Makkari the speedster. It is hard to see how these characters will have a future intertwined with the rest of the MCU stories but it does day ""the eternals will return..."" at the end.",Pos
"The movie opened today where I live, so I saw it!",Neu
"""Eternals"" is an Action - Drama movie in which we watch the start of a new saga of Marvel. The Eternals are a group of immortal beings living on Earth, helping people throughout its whole history and through all civilizations.",Neu
"First, the Eternals is visually appeasing, funny at times, exciting at others, and tells a complex story. Yeah, and I sorta hated it.",Neg
Honestly felt trapped in the cinema. If I wasn't with people I would have walked out. I would rather watch Thor 2 on a loop for 24 hours than watch this film again.,Neg
"Eternals is a new superhero movie in the Marvel film series. The film is directed and part written by Chlo√© Zhao, the director of The Rider and Nomadland.",Neu
"Again a lot of negative reviews on here. Negative reviews from people that will never be satisfied, whatever movie you make they will always bash it down. The funniest of them all is from a reviewer rating it with three stars. He watched it twice! Is that not ridiculous? Watching a movie that you score that low twice? I only watch movies that I really liked twice and Eternals is going to be one of them. The story is interesting, the CGI's stunning, the acting more than decent (but that's absolutely normal when you see the great cast it has). There's clearly going to be a sequel, one that I will watch for sure. I just hope those negative people will skip that one, as it's going to be of the same level. So if you for some obscure reason didn't like Eternals just do us a favor and skip that one and let the Marvel fans enjoy their movies.",Pos
"I enjoyed the spectacular special effects but, unlike Shang Chi, the storyline played second fiddle to the aesthetics. It focuses too much on (Harry) style, but with little to inadequate substance. It had a star studded cast from whom I expected or at least hoped for better than what was delivered.",Neg
"I enjoyed this movie way more than I thought I would. It's definitely superior to anything else that's come out since Endgame. If you think, like I thought, that the movie would be overcrowded, it's really not. Every character brings a unique perspective, their relationships are genuine, and you sympathize with both those in the right and those in the wrong. There are some surprises, but the kind where you look back and think, ok, that makes sense. Plus the acting, cinematography, and storytelling overall are amazing.",Pos
"How can anyone give this movie a good rating is beyond me. Movie has no substance, a deranged some one might call a plot. And 15 minutes of action in a 2-1/2 hour movie, rest of which is total boring. So they advertise 5 minutes of action to try to sell a real flop imo. I wasted my money to see this movie. Anybody that reads my reviews knows I hate to give really low reviews, i really have to dislike a movie a lot in order to give only one star.",Neg
"Wow! This is nothing like any of the earlier MCU movies. Kudos to Chlo√© Zhao for stepping out of MCU's comfort zone in creating a visionary experience and a film that stands out for its stunning location shots, eye-popping action scenes, a diverse cast (including Marvel's first gay character) and infectious performances - thumbs up to the two leads Gemma Chan and Richard Madden for their engaging screen presence and chemistry. There's plenty of humour and wit too, and despite its almost 160 minute run-time, the movie moves at breakneck speed to tell its story of the origins of mankind. A great turning point for Phase 4 of the Marvel Cinematic Universe.",Pos
"After watching this movie I am still not sure if I liked it or not. It was something different than all the other marvel movies, but it does not mean that it was different in a bad way. The plot could had been written a little bit better, because there were a few scenes that could had been better. I did not expect such scene after the credits, I would have to say that it surprised me.",Pos
Ok i have never fallen asleep during ANY Marvel movie until i saw eternals.. Sooo long with lack of action and too much sappy dialog. Also you kill off the hottest character first! But at least Jon Snow got to be reunited with his cousin Rob Stark. And he still knows nothing!!,Neg
I wasn't prepared to be moved to tears but there I was.,Pos
"Since this movie was first announced, it'd piqued my interest. I personally was holding out hope that this would finally be an MCU film with a group of characters from space who I actually liked and weren't a bunch of a-holes. An opening crawl not only explains who Eternals are, but Deviants and Celestials too. There's enough exposition through dialogue to answer any questions one might have whilst watching (such as why these Eternals were 'Switzerland' during the battle against Thanos). Complaints about this film being 'confusing' because it alternates between past and present must be from those with short attention spans, as it's quite obvious what time period the movie's in at any given time thanks to helpful location title cards. Too many characters? I think not. Endgame had 30-something characters and nobody complained. Each of these Eternals has a distinct personality.",Pos
"Robb died and Jon is about to go fight the bad guys with a sword, It's like GOT all over again, only now Cersei doesn't drink that much wine.",Pos
"""Eternals"" is a stylized movie directed by Chlo√© Zhao. And her style is partially what makes this film feel like no other Marvel movie. Like most of her works, this movie feels realistic; partly due to the use of natural light and no slow motion. Making the lighting look natural makes otherwise absurd scenes look slightly more realistic.",Pos
"I like it since the beginning of the story. It's been cool to see eternals through the ages, but the past-to-present contrast isn't that smooth. The characters are cool and their powers are awesome, but it's frustrating in some scenes. But overall, it's actually a good movie, so it shouldn't be underestimated like that, the scale is big, it's epic, the visual work is very beautiful, very spectacular, want to see it again to enjoy the visual work.",Pos
Eternals,Neu
I really enjoyed this different pace MCU film. So many questions left at the end. It will be interesting to see where the MCU goes from here and how everything is tied together. The film had me on the edge of my seat. Amazing visuals and a great cast.,Pos
"While I wouldn't say that Eternals deserves to be the lowest rated MCU movie (My personal pick for worst MCU film is Thor The Dark World), there are glaring issues with the plot, editing and pacing of the film that should have been addressed.",Pos
"After hearing so much bad reviews for this movie, I almost didn't watch it. But now after watching it TWICE, I have to say the reviews are flawed! This was a really good movie. From the story, the effects, the costumes, right down to the fight scenes which were just took dope and watching Angelina kick@$$ was so sexy. I've missed her in such action roles. I in particularly loved how they took us on a journey of discovering who the Eternals were and why they existed. I also loved how each Character had a moment to shine. Everyone played their role beautifully, the only let down for me was the forced gay character in there. Aside that, the movie made sense and I can't wait to see how they fight the big guy in the next one.",Pos
...they care for each other and they love so they are worth saving.... I mean how many times is that storyline going to be regurgitated? And as an eternal it took you 7000 years to figure that one out?,Neg
"Compiling bunch of name actors and throwing them into a movie with total mess, boring conversations and weak story, no the visuals won't help out. One of the worst marvel productions (join the DC bad movies).",Neg
Eternals starts with a text explaining the creation of the world and the reason of the Eternals; but the last line says everything changed after the last mission.,Neu
Visually stunning.,Pos
"The Good: If I have to give Eternals credit for any single thing, it's how distinct this movie is from the rest of the MCU. It's slower paced, more muted, more mature (in parts), and thankfully, lacking the ""comedy"" of the other Marvel movies. Zhao's cinematography is really nice too, even if the action scenes are lacking a punch. Action is clearly not her forte.",Pos
"'Eternals' is boring. There's no introduction to the characters playing the heroes. There's no introduction of the villain(s). There's no character building what so ever. I'm one who believes you DO NOT NEED an origin story for every film, but that doesn't mean you should expect everyone to know who these characters are and proceed from there. The dialogue was poor. So bad that I became easily distracted by the audience around me. The people around me were not enjoying this movie either. There's a lot of conversation from the beginning to the middle, but I simply can not recall a single one. It's a Marvel movie, and yet there were ZERO quotable lines for us to rejoice in or share in hashtags. The Deviants, the creatures or heroes battle were basic stock villains you'd see added to the background of a big boss fight. Salma Hayek is easily recognizable, we learn she's in charge, and yet you see her the least. When her character is found dead, you don't care. The characters weep and mourn, but obviously they knew her far better than she was presented. IMHO the Director chose to focus solely on diversity than basic character structure.",Neg
"Yes I know its part of the mcu, but if you look at this movie as a seperate entity it becomes better in some ways. In this movie we find out about the ancient race of superheros, who were the first ones on earth. They are acted by a pretty great group of actors including gemma chan and richard madden. All of them were good and no characters felt out of place. The cgi couldve been a little better and its evident that this movie is not as great as the other offerings, but it still is good at giving us a glimpse as to other characters that will come into the mcu and interact with other characters in secret walking. Overall an interesting and good marvel film, but not without the flaws.",Pos
I don't understand why people like to review bomb new/different movies. There's literally people on this program that will watch EVERY SINGLE Marvel movie and hate on them all. If you hate them all so bad why are you watching it?,Pos
"This one-of-a-kind movie is a story like an ode to this planet, its history, but moreover the humanity, from its worst to its best aspects... And the complexity of life, whoever you are, the role we can choose or not to play... Yes, all these choices and opposite beliefs that make this world a big dramatic mess at times, but also a wonderful place that happens to generate the most magnificent things there is... And how deep, heartfelt connections are a decisive factor ; because love, in the end, is what matters and gives any life trajectory a more fulfilled feel... Even if this love takes you to your absolute demise, your existence will nonetheless have had a greater meaning and resonance with it...",Pos
"I really wanted to enjoy this movie, the acting was very good as were the special effects, but the movie felt over long and deliberately stretched. Out of all the possible comics in the MCU, I think this was a mistake, it's the same thing I feel about Captain Marvel, they are too powerful, godlike, they don't have enough flaws. I think this would have been better as a stand-alone.",Neg
